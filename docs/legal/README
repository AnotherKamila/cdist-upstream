Around 20 Jule 2016 year was discovered issue, that while all code is
GPLv3+ licensed, type documentation is GPLv3 only. As such
contributors was emailed to ask them permission to relicense to
GPLv3+.

This directory contains emails, containing permission with all
headers. Not sure about legal significance, since email is so easy to
forge, but it is best option availiable.
