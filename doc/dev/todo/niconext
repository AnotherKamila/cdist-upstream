core/__cdist_object_code_run:
   make remote run work again

__cdist_code_run:
   should be changed to run _all_ code (has nice checks)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- run-remote does not work anymore, because there is no binary :-)
   either make functions available on the other side or
   put logic on the server side.

   - trying to run type explorers nicely from local side
      - must check whether type directory has been transmitted before!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   - Both type and global have...
      - local sourcedir
      - remote destination dir
      - remote out dir
      - local out dir

   - Differences are in...
      - variables exposed / submitted

  


Catch broken instances in cdist-mass-deploy -p and report broken deployements at the end!
