This branch contains experimental features for cdist 4.x:

    - install support
    - preos support

They are not yet stable:

    - use them at your own risk
    - all __install types may change at any time (syntax, parameter, etc.)
    - explorers for install may be broken

    - core code is based on the master branch, but
      contains changes for install and preos feature


In short:
